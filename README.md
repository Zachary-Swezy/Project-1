# Project-1
Cloud architecture project for Northwestern University
Here we have set up a secure cloud Network using virtual machines and security networks. One network operates two virtual machines which can only be accessed through our Jumpbox-VM, which contains the SSH key to navigate into ansible containers and other virtual machines.
On a separate virtual security network we have set up an ELK server. Using Kibana, Filebeat, and Metricbeat, we are able to monitor traffic to our database and flag any potentially malicious behavior.
